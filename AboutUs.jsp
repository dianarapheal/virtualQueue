                <td>It is that time of the year when all eyes are focused on the Sabarimala Sree Ayyappa Temple. Pilgrims have already started making their way to Kerala in hopes of earning the blessings of Lord Ayyappa. In the next three months, a deluge of people are anticipated to visit this holy shrine. Though Makara Vilakku (on January 14, 2018) is the main draw at this temple, but presently devotees are rushing to the Sree Ayyappa Temple to pay their reverence during Mandala Pooja Mahotsavam (from November 11-December 26, 2017). In the coming months Sabarimala will see one of the largest conglomeration of devotees, who defy the hardships in favour of their faith.</td>

                <td>The temple of Lord Ayyappan gets its mention as early as 12th century, when the Prince of Pandalam dynasty known as Manikandan, mediated at the ancient temple. It is believed that on the holy day of Makaravilakku, Lord Rama and his brother Lakhsmana met Sabari, a tribal Goddess and were blessed by her. It is also the day, when it is believed that Lord Dharmashasta stops his meditation to bless all the devotees visiting the temple. With the hopes of getting divine blessings, millions of devotees make their way towards the temple.</td>

                <td>Sabarimala is one of the most difficult pilgrimages. It takes a prior preparation, and not just anyone can take this walk of faith. To undertake such a pilgrimage the devotee needs to be both physically and mentally fit. So, how do prospective pilgrims prepare?

                    Preparations start with a 41 day Vratham (fasting). This Vratham should usually begin on the first day of Vrischikam (according to Malayalam calendar) in mid November.
                    During the Vratham, one cannot attend any social activity and spend time praying or singing bhajans. This should also be accompanied with visiting the temples, cleaning them, feeding and helping the poor or sick people.
                    He must sleep on the floor, use a wooden block for a pillow and walk bare feet.
                    He must also not oil his body or his hair and must always carry a tulsi leaf with him to keep away evil thoughts.
                    During the days of Vratham, devotees must eat only pure vegetarian food and abstain from physical or verbal violence, alcohol and tobacco and intoxicants in any form.
                    If you are travelling to Sabarimala by train you can order exclusive Sabrimala fast (vrat) food through the RailYatri app. RailYatri has been offering Satvik food for group travelers to Sabrimala food for the last 4 years.</td>
